# ESports-Website-Template

Hi their,
Myself Vrushal Bhilpawar i'm in 1st year electronics and Telecommunication branch engineering student.

today i made an ESports Website template. i have made it by using technologies such as:
1. html
2. css
from this i have learned and created a simple template of a gaming website which provides you a gaming platform where you will get all information about this gaming world and 
you will get to know tournaments as well as latest games top recent games and much more information.
i have tries it to make responsive but due to lack of time i cant complete it to be fully responsive
but i have put my all the efforts and designed it completely.
i have also added one js link to beautify my icons.
and i have taken images from onclick media website itself and a logo which is given in my project

you can open this website in vs code and just have to open live server you will get the whole website seen in your browser.


hope you will like my project.
thank you.
have a nice day.
